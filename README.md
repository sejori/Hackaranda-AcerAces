# Env Vars
Environment Variables can unlock some additional functionality. The method of using environment variables depends on the environment:
- `KEY=VALUE npm start` for the majority of cases
    - This enables the variable for this `npm start` command only and no following commands
- `$key=value; npm start` for powershell
    - This enables the variable for the process, and hence for all following commands.
## TIMEOUT
- The `TIMEOUT` environment variable is preset when the bot is launched by the server.
- It contains the timeout limit for each move. 

## DEBUG
- Setting `DEBUG` to `true` enables you to see both hands when playing against a bot.

## NOCOLOUR
- Setting `NOCOLOUR` to `true` disables the `chalk` module, and hence any colours.
    - Use if there are any issues with cards blending into backgrounds.
